# ![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) Master Detail Flow

## Feature Tasks
Convert your errands google maps app to use single fragment activities, then
implement a master-detail flow.

## Stretch Goals

  Fragment so update where the map is pointed at instead of creating a new
  MapFragment each time you choose a new errand from the list.
